# Wavefunction Collapse Dataset

Formatted for Arc AGI. Now with generator code!

This is a dataset generated with wave function collapse. The goal of this data is to map some pattern to some program. It should be solvable by humanes

The code to generate the dataset is included in generator. You can generator a much larger dataset, or change the constraints, or make it more complex.

## Run the generator

```bash
python -m wfc_generator.generate
```
